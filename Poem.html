    <main>
        <div> A frigid sound of a violin</div>
        <div>Bird sweeps across the frozen river</div>
        <div>and watches us from above
            as if looking at the fish trapped beneath the ice</div>
        <div>Bird crashes into the window
            triggering a symptom</div>
        <div>My nosebleed drips into milk
            In the scattered crowd at the snow-covered square</div>
        <div>two people walk side by side
            It’s cold isn’t it?</div>
        <div>No!</div>
        <div>Perhaps we are the violin’s cradle
            The opening and closing</div>
        <div>of the gap between you and me</div>
        <div>as if it were alive
        a lumpy, transparent bird
            too precious to be touched</div>
        <div>It hurts to look down from above</div>
        <div>Two people walk side by side</div>
        <div>like the way the light switches for the dining room and kitchen sink are perfectly in line</div>
        <div>like two words that appear on the back of the page</div>
        <div>written by my teacher, drowsy from a painkiller</div>
        <div>How wonderful if there were no doors in this or that world</div>
        <div>I finally feel it
        that the world becomes as flat as a mirror if bird doesn’t fly
        that’s why my bird flies even in sleep</div>
        <div>Bird pecks on the glass again
        triggering a symptom</div>
        <div>From up in the air I can see</div>
        <div>you and me walking
        as if I were looking at the fish</div>
        <div>trapped beneath the ice</div>
